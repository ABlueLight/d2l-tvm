# Getting Started

Let's start your journey! There's a lot to learn, but every journey starts
somewhere. In this part, we'll discuss:

- Installing required libaries so you can run (almost) every chapter by youself
- Writing an operator that adds two vectors
- Compiling a neural network model to run the inference, and saving the
  compiled library
