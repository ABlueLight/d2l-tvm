Dive into Deep Learning Compiler
================================

**Working in progress. Please check back later.**

This project is for readers who are interested in high-performance
implementation of their programs for scientific computing, but may only know
NumPy before. We are not aiming to replace the tutorials available at tvm.ai,
but for more easy-to-read tutorials with a consistent theme among each
section.
